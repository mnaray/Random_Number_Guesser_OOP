# Random_Number_Guesser_OOP
This is the object oriented version of my original Random Number Guesser from the previous year of school.

### Explanation
Last year we made the same project, but only with the help of the Program class.  
We barely used any methods and didn't use any classes at all.  
  
This project should become a sort of "makeover" of the one we made last year.
